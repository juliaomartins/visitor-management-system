 * The backend is a separate origin (uvicorn on :8000) and emits no CORS headers —
 * django-cors-headers is not installed. Rather than ask the backend to change,
 * the dashboard proxies to it, so every browser request is same-origin:
 *
 *   - no CORS preflight on the Authorization header
 *   - the httpOnly refresh cookie is set and sent as a first-party cookie
 *   - visitor photos resolve, since DRF builds absolute URLs from the Host header
 *     and would otherwise point at :3000 with no route behind it
 *
 * Set VMS_BACKEND_ORIGIN to the server's LAN address for the event.
