 * A global search box and a notification bell used to sit here. Both are gone.
 * The search duplicated the one already on the visitor list a few pixels below
 * it — which was the only place a result could land anyway — and the bell
 * repeated the amber dot the rail already shows on Devices. A second control for
 * a job the page already does is not a feature; it is a thing to keep in sync.
 *
 * The clock stays because it duplicates nothing. Everything this app does is
 * measured against "doors open at nine", and a stopped clock is also the cheapest
 * possible proof that the tab has frozen.
