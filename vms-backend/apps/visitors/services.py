"""Visitor business logic. Views stay thin; this is where the rules live.

Two of these functions are load-bearing for the whole security model:

* ``badge_token`` derives the raw token for a visitor. It is deterministic, so
  the same QR can be reprinted and displayed for the life of the event, and it
  is an HMAC under a server secret, so it cannot be forged from the visitor id
  alone (CLAUDE.md constraint #3 — the QR is still opaque, just no longer
  irrecoverable).
* ``rotate_badge_token`` is the only thing that changes a badge's QR. Printing
  no longer does.
* ``deactivate_visitor`` stops a badge scanning without touching its scan
  history, and ``activate_visitor`` puts it back. The QR is unchanged by both:
  the token is derived, so the same printed card resumes working.
* ``purge_visitor`` is the only destructive path. It erases the registration for
  real, and it is not what ``DELETE /visitors/{id}`` does.
